1. When you upgrade your ammo ammount, it needs to handle the ammo packs in your inventory at the time.
2. Smooth out the loading levels
3! Add the money icon in the top left to the upgrade station UI
4. Better chance for enemy spawns. (I already messed with this a little)
5! Don't stop the time scale right away when you die, because what happens is if you die to an explosion in doesnt spawn the explosion in.
6! Crates need to have better spawn rates. Example: 50% chance the item spawned is ammo, 15% chance med kid, 15% adrenaline, 15% pill, 5% wrench 
7. Adjust enemy spawns so that the most common is ATK and CHAIN with SLNK being less common and SPDR being most common
9. When money is picked up, it would be really nice to see how much money you earned (Maybe like a little +$X in the top right or something)
10! Enemies vary on how much money they drop.
